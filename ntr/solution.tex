Interactive visualization, with the capabilities of analyzing and reviewing data, 
is an efficient solution to improve the interpretability of machine learning 
systems. It also can help data scientists gain insights into the data and the 
system to further improve performance. To answer the questions posed above: 
(1) outliers in training data will more or less hurt the model's performance, 
and novelty detection methods along with an interactive visualization interface 
could help identify and correct them; (2) a consensus label analyzer along with 
an interactive visualization interface could help provide answers to whether or 
not the crowd-sourced labels recover ground truth; (3) a mis-classification 
analyzer along with an interactive visualization interface would help provide 
insights to why the model incorrectly classifies certain features. In order to 
accomplish these challenges, we designed and implemented a light-weight 
expandable framework for interactive data analysis and visualization.
